# The Purge - Game Design Document Progress
## Unit 3 Completion Devlog

### 📅 Date: January 11, 2025
### 🎯 Milestone: Unit 3 Completion - Core Gameplay Systems Documentation

#### 🔄 Today's Progress

We've successfully completed the documentation of core gameplay systems for The Purge, our cooperative survival horror FPS. Key achievements include:

1. **Detailed Character System Documentation**
   - Established four unique playable characters with distinct abilities
   - Created balanced role distribution for cooperative gameplay
   - Documented specific abilities for each character archetype

2. **Advanced AI Systems Design**
   - Implemented detailed documentation for the "Sabuesos" (guard dogs) AI system
   - Developed five distinct behavioral states for enemy AI
   - Created comprehensive scent and sound detection mechanics

3. **Survival Mechanics Documentation**
   - Established three-tier wound system
   - Documented healing item hierarchy
   - Integrated survival mechanics with AI detection systems

4. **Environmental Hazards**
   - Documented various trap types and their mechanics
   - Created systemic interaction between traps and player states
   - Designed counterplay mechanics for each hazard type

#### 🔍 Technical Insights

The documentation now includes detailed specifications for:
- AI behavior trees and state machines
- Environmental interaction systems
- Player status effects and their propagation
- Trap triggering and avoidance mechanics

#### 🎮 Gameplay Loop Refinements

- Enhanced cooperative gameplay through interdependent character abilities
- Created tension through persistent threat systems (dogs, cameras, traps)
- Established risk-reward mechanics in healing and movement systems

#### 📚 Lessons Learned

1. Importance of systemic design in horror games
2. Balance between player empowerment and vulnerability
3. Integration of narrative elements through environmental storytelling
4. Effective documentation of complex AI behaviors

#### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Begin prototyping core movement and interaction systems
2. Create initial AI behavior prototypes
3. Design level layouts based on documented mechanics
4. Implement basic trap and security systems

### 🔧 Technical Foundations

The document now provides clear guidelines for implementing:
- Character control systems
- AI behavior patterns
- Environmental hazard triggers
- Player status management
- Cooperative gameplay mechanics

#### 🎨 Design Philosophy Updates

The documentation emphasizes:
- Tension through systemic interactions
- Player choice and consequence
- Cooperative problem-solving
- Environmental storytelling
- Dynamic threat response
