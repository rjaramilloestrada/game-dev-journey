ðŸŽ® Game Development Journey ðŸŽ®

Current Project: Project Tayos
I am developing a 2D Metroidvania game inspired by Ecuador's enigmatic Cave of Tayos. This project is my foundational learning platform and marks my serious entry into game development.

Project Goals

1. Craft a compelling Metroidvania game that showcases real-world Ecuadorian locations, history, and mythology
2. Document the entire development process, from concept to completion
3. Master and implement best practices in game development
4. Establish a comprehensive skill set across various disciplines, including:

- Game Design
- Narrative Design
- Level Design
- Programming

Additionally, I will gain a foundational understanding of:

- Art and Animation (leveraging AI for prototyping, with plans to collaborate with talented artists)
- Sound Design (acquiring the basics, with opportunities for future collaboration)

Development Philosophy:
This repository is a transparent account of my game development journey. I am committed to:

- Learning in public
- Sharing both successes and challenges
- Being transparent about utilizing AI and other tools for prototyping
- Evolving from a beginner to a skilled game developer

Repository Structure:

/devlogs - Regular development updates and progress reports
/design-docs - Comprehensive game design documents and planning
/learning-resources - Valuable resources and learning materials

Current Focus
I am on a structured learning path through 2024-2025 that includes:

1. Documentation (Current Phase)
2. Narrative Design (Current Phase)
3. Level Design
4. Technical Implementation
5. Project Development
6. Demo
