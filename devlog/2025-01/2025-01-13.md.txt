## Lessons Learned

### Main Character Documentation
Today I learned the crucial importance of thorough character documentation in game design. Key takeaways:
- Character psychology and background story are fundamental to creating believable protagonists
- Abilities and skills need to be clearly documented for development purposes
- Character design should support gameplay mechanics
- Documentation should cover both narrative and mechanical aspects of the character

### Enemy Design Documentation
Gained valuable insights into NPC and enemy design:
- Distinction between generic enemies and boss characters
- Importance of detailed behavior documentation
- Movement patterns and AI behavior types
- Combat engagement patterns
- Need for clear documentation of enemy mechanics and behaviors
