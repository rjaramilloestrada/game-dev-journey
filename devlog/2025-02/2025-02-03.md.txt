Game Design Journey - Course Completion Devlog
Course Completion Milestone
Successfully completed the Introduction to Game Design course at Domestika! ðŸŽ® The journey has been incredibly enlightening, especially when it came to the final project.
The Evolution of Ideas
Initial Concept: The Purge Co-op Experience
Started ambitious with a 4-player cooperative game based on The Purge:

Expanded on course work
Complex multiplayer mechanics
Rich narrative elements
Multiple intertwining systems

The Learning Moment: Scope Management
As development progressed, I encountered a valuable lesson in game design:

Ideas began multiplying exponentially
Mechanics kept branching into new systems
Feature creep started becoming apparent
Realized the importance of maintaining focused design

The Pivot: Embracing "Less is More"
Made the decision to redirect my efforts:

Understood that effective game design isn't about quantity
Recognized the value of focused, polished mechanics
Learned that constraints often breed creativity

Current Project: Cave of the Tayos
Project Overview
Developing a focused metroidvania platformer based on Ecuador's mysterious Cave of the Tayos:

2D platformer mechanics
Metroidvania progression
Based on real-world location
Cultural elements integration

Development Status

GDD in progress
Core mechanics defined
World structure planned
More updates coming soon...

Key Learnings

Scope management is crucial
Quality over quantity in game design
Cultural inspiration can create unique experiences
The importance of focused design documents

Stay tuned for more updates as the Cave of the Tayos GDD development continues...
